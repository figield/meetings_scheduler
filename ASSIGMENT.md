## Brief introduction

The custom built system for handling meetings which has been around since the beginning of time
and which is now deemed too hard to use. The management has asked for an application that works independently of the existing system and
that can be called to get suggestions for suitable meeting times based on the following parameters:
- participants (employee ids), one or multiple
- desired meeting length (minutes)
- earliest and latest requested meeting date and time
- office hours (e.g. 08-17)

### Solution requirements

The application can be either an HTTP API or a console application.
At regular intervals all information is dumped from the existing system to a number of text files where the
freebusy.txt file contains details on when all employees are busy the next few weeks.
An excerpt from the file can look like this:

```

```

As it seems, the file has lines in two different formats where the first one contains employee id and display
name and the second format has information on the time slots where the employee is busy and therefore not
available for meetings.
The following can be good to know:
- In the file, all times stated can be treated as local times â€“ no need to adjust for timezone differences,
- the file may contain some irregularities, these should be ignored,
- the system only handles meetings that start every whole and half hour, e.g. 08.00, 08.30, 09.00, etc.
